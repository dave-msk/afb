class Broker(object):
  """Broker for object creation.

  The Broker serves as a switch box / proxy that delegates the object creation
  to the corresponding manufacturer. Each registered manufacturer is identified
  by their intended output object class. The Broker registers itself to each of
  the manufacturers in their registration, so that the manufacturers could
  forward the object creation during preparation of input parameters to the
  target factory.

  To link manufacturers through a Broker, call the `register` method:

  ```python
  mfr_a = Manufacturer(A)
  mfr_b = Manufacturer(B)

  afb = Broker()

  afb.register(mfr_a)
  afb.register(mfr_b)
  # Or one can simply call the `register_all` method to register an iterable
  # of `Manufacturer`s.
  # afb.register_all([mfr_a, mfr_b])
  ```
